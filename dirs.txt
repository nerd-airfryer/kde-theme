To control transperancy, use color schemes (.local/share/color-scheme), enter values as (r,g,b,a) where a is alpha (0 - 255)
For widgets like wifi and app launcher, use plasma styles to configure their transparency
Avoid custom accent colors
Use better blur desktop effect

Settings with alpha scheme is buggy, to apply color scheme to specific app, copy the systemsettigns from /usr/share/applications to its corrosponding in .local, this repo will help
https://github.com/shalva97/kde-configuration-files and then append the color scheme to the end of the .desktop file
